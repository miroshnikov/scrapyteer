# Scrapyteer

Scrapyteer is a web scraping/crawling tool built on top of headless Chrome browser.
While it may not work as fast as raw http requests it has a huge advantage as it allows to scrape both plain html pages and javascript generated content.
Scrapyteer allows you to scrape any SPA (Single-Page Application) no matter what javascript framework is used.
